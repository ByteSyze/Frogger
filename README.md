# Frogger
===========

Developed by Tyler Hackett. My first attempt at a complete game in Unity - Frogger 3D! 

Additional nagging & motivational manic depressive episodes provided by my good friend Raniy.


Remember all those fond memories of getting hit by cars and drowning in rivers? Well now you can relive those peak moments in your life on a much harder to run, poorly developed, overall bad remake of the exact same game!


As this game also serves as my initial learning stages of Unity, you can expect a slew of weird and unrelated testy things on the way to a final product.
